# callsheet-localizations
Localization Files for [Callsheet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/callsheet-find-cast-crew/id1672356376).

## Basics

This repository contains a series of [string catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog) files. They contain a series of translatable snippets, and, eventually, their translations.

The easiest way to open and modify these files &mdash;¬†other than using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) &mdash; is to use the free macOS app [Loca Studio](https://www.cunningo.com/locastudio/index.html).

## Using Loca Studio

Generally speaking, you can look at the `ID` column, and provide a translation in the `Target` column. However, there are some special cases:

### Plurality

For some items, like age, will occasionally have a singular and a plural form. Look at the ages shown here:

This isn't _super_ obvious in Loca Studio:

Note that the `Source` column kind of hints at what's going on here, but the `ID` column shows `plural.one` for the singular version and `plural.other` for the plural version. Fill each in as appropriate, please.

## Submission Flow

I've never done this before, so I'm working this out as we go, as well. But here's my vision for how I hope this will work:

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/cliss/callsheet-localizations/fork)
2. Perform whatever translations you want
    * Please don't feel obligated to do the whole document! Any little bit helps!
3. Create a pull request to this repository
4. I'll review, and, short of a major issue, accept the PR
5. We both get to enjoy Callsheet being in one more language!
6. If you happen to be an [ATP](https://atp.fm/) listener, and if you _do_ complete an entire language's localization, let me know, and maybe an ATP sticker will get mailed to you. üòè

## Wait, there are forks other than cutlery and roads?

I'm guessing you're not experienced with Github. No problem! Reach out (see below) and we'll see if there's an alternative approach we can use. üòä

## What if my language isn't here?

Reach out (see below) and I'll be happy to add it!
